# Transformer in machine learning tasks

🎯 The goal of this project was to help users in their careers by providing simple guidance while writing professional or academic documents.

We decided to opt for specific types of deep learning models named transformers to achieve our aim. 
To achieve our goal we decided to opt for Hugging face transformers. First of all, let's define Hugging Face, It is a company based in Brooklyn that develops application programming interfaces (APIs) to download pre-trained models and use them for specific tasks such as:

* ✍️ NLP: Natural language processing
* 🖼️ Image recognition
* 📝 Text-generation
* 🎧 Audio tasks
